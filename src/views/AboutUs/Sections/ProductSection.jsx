              This project was created as a senior thesis for the University
              of Vermont's Honors College class of 2020. Over the past several
              years there have been incredible advancements in machine learning
              and object detection. Theyâ€™re now being used in everything from
              security systems to self-driving cars, to automated sorting
              facilities. One area that has had little benefit from the
              advancements in breaking down the communication barriers between
              the Deaf and those who are unable to understand sign language.
              A project that was initially designed as a translation tool
              took on took an unexpected turn that looked deeper
              at the differences and challenges among various object detection
              algorithms, how computing power affects how fast and efficiently
              code can run, and how difficult it can be to work with people.
